Restaraunt System:

This system allows the customer to input the number of diners which are then used to display the available tables.
The customer can then select a table of there choice.

Menu System:

The menu system holds all of the menus. The customer has the option to look through all of the available food items selecting
items they wish to add to their order. This order is then submitted and the customer pays for that order. The customer can then 
their order with the tracking system built into the menu system. Once the order is complete the customer is able to place anothr
order if they so wish.

Kicten System:

The kitchen system simply allows kitchen staff to retrieve currently active orders. They are then able to set the order status,
removing any comlete orders from the UI.
